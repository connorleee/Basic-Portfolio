            <p>After being in the construction industry for 3 years as a Heavy Civil construction contractor, I am looking to learn an entirely new skill and switch careers to something entirely different with web development.</p>
            <p>A few of the projects I've worked on include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Amtrak - King Street Station Improvements</li>
                <li>BNSF - Kent/Orillia Yard Improvements</li>
                <li>Sound Transit - Operations and Maintenance Facility: East</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Outside of work, here are a few of my hobbies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Music - Guitar, Vocals</li>
                <li>Photography</li>
                <li>Racing Cars</li>
            </ul>
